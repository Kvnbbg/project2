## How to Run

### Step 1: Check Your Current Location
Open your terminal and execute the following command to see where you are currently located within your file system:

```bash
ls
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Folder
Use `cd` (change directory) to move to the directory containing the script. For example, if your script is located in a folder named "talk_to_model", execute:

```bash
cd ./user/talk_to_model
```

### Step 3: Run the Script
Execute the script by typing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
./talk_to_model.sh
```

This command will run the script and initiate the AI chat interface in your terminal.

Replace `./user/talk_to_model` with the actual path where your script is located. Additionally, include an image named `cd.png` within the `images` folder to showcase how the terminal looks when the script is running.

Make sure to update the paths and commands to match your specific file structure and script location. This guide will help users navigate to the correct directory and run the script in their terminal.
